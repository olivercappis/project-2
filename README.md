# Love Connect Dating Application

the form can be filled and submitted to create a new account. After creating user account, user will be taken back to log in page to log in before being able to see all the selection from the database. All data is divided into 2 selections of men and women, based on user's interest can click on either men or women to show all available men and women in the database.

Each result provides only the information expected to be most useful to the user: A name, 
age, and a brief description about themseveles, as well as a button link to connect to that person if the user is interested. Users can also click on profile button to show their information plus who are they currently connected to. There is also an option to disconnect the current connection if they choose to do so. The intent of this application is to develop a place where user can connect and find their love interest over the internet.
